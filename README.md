# Calorie_burnt
# Description
This project focuses on predicting calories burnt during various physical activities using machine learning techniques. It leverages the power of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and XGBoost Regressor algorithm to create an accurate predictive model.

The core components of this project include:

Data Preprocessing: Utilizing Pandas, the dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and features are prepared for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful insights from the data using NumPy for array operations. This step enhances the model's ability to capture important patterns.

Model Training: Employing the XGBoost Regressor algorithm from Scikit-learn for building the predictive model. This algorithm is known for its high performance and handling non-linear relationships effectively.

Evaluation and Visualization: Using Scikit-learn metrics to assess the model's performance. Matplotlib is employed to create insightful visualizations such as feature importance plots and prediction comparisons.

# Usage
Open and run the notebooks in the notebooks directory sequentially to understand each step of the project.

Customize the dataset or experiment with different hyperparameters to further enhance the model's performance.

Modify visualizations or create additional ones using Matplotlib to gain deeper insights into the dataset and model.
